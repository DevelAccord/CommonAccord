Testing
=======

Tests are important. Even though you may want to deliberately skip some in your prototypes, knowing
you can throw out a solid testing architecture in a snap is always great.

.. code-block:: shell

    make lint
    make test

After a `make test` run, you'll find coverage reports in the `coverage` folder.
