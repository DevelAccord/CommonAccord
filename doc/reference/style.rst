Style
=====

You want your application to be beautiful, as a default, right? You don't want to spend huge amount
of time setting it up, right?

We chosed a few defaults for that:

* SASS
* Bootstrap 4
* Font Awesome

Those are defaults, not requirements, but it allows us to provide a base framework to develop your
prototypes as quickly as possible. Feel free to replace it with whatever you want as your project
grows.
