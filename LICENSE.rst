CREDITS AND THANKS
==================

Current status of this project would not have been possible without the help of:

* React Starter Kit by Konstantin Tarkus for the scripts in bin/ (originally from
  https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit tools).

* Aymeric Augustin for help with Karma (tests) and Istanbul (coverage)
  configuration.

* An amazing number of various open source react/node/express/whatever
  boilerplates available Internet from which I borrowed little parts, here and
  there.

* A lot of guys and projects I could not list here, that helped make my way through
  rapid yet solid software development.
